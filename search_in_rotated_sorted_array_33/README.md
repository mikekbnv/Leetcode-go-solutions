# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

# Description

You are given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order, and an integer target.
Suppose that nums is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
If target is found in the array return its index, otherwise, return -1

Example 1:

```
Input:
[4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output:
4
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
[4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output:
-1
```

Example 3:

```
Input:
[1], target = 0
Output:
-1
```
