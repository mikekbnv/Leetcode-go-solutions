# 910. Smallest Range II

https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-ii/

# Description

Given an array A of integers, for each integer A[i] we need to choose either x = -K or x = K, and add x to A[i] (only once).

After this process, we have some array B.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and the minimum value of B.

Example 1:

```
Input:
A = [1], K = 0
Output:
0
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
A = [0,10], K = 2
Output:
6
```

Example 3:

```
Input:
A = [1,3,6], K = 3
Output:
3
```
